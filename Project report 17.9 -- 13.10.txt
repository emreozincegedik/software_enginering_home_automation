19.9.19 libraries
"Wire.h" sda scl communication enabler
"RTClib.h" ds3231 module timer
<Adafruit_SSD1306.h> OLED screen
no bluetooth library (serial communication)
no soil moisture library (analog read)
no lamp library (analog read)

20.9.19 algorithm
Arduino pulls time from DS3231 with RTClib library and writes to screen
Arduino reads soil moisture sensor from analog pin A13, 
  if the received signal is low, pin 53 will be opened and relay will power water pump.
  Once the moisture sensor sends high signal, pin 53 will be closed and water pump will stop.
  Water level will be shown in both OLED screen and phone via bluetooth module
Arduino reads electricty status from analog pin A0, 
  if electricity stops, Arduino takes note of current time with DS3231 module, counts how much time passed between the electricty stop
  and electricty becoming available. Shows the process on screen and phone
Arduino reads lamp status and shows on screen and phone. Phone sends signal to arduino and arduino opens or closes the specified lamp

25.9.19 Interface design
How it will be look on OLED screen and phone are designed with Windows' Paint program

26.9.19 Summary
In short, this part is not coding but making short way for how coding logic will look like
  also how interface will look like
